# ruby-projects
Considering the number the projects I've been doing for The Odin Project lately, I figured I'll just start making one master-repo for everything. This will be for Ruby and possibly Rails projects. I might move my existing Ruby projects into this distro.

Projects include:

-Hangman (via TOP's Files and Serialization) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/file-i-o-and-serialization)
-JumpStart MicroBlogger (via TOP's Ruby on the Web) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-on-the-web)
-Recursive Fibonacci (via TOP's Recursion project) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion)
-Merge Sort (as above)
