# ruby-projects
Considering the number the projects I've been doing for The Odin Project lately, I figured I'll just start making one master-repo for everything. This will be for the Ruby projects I've done via TOP. I might move my existing Ruby projects into this distro.

Projects include:
- Hangman (via TOP's Files and Serialization) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/file-i-o-and-serialization)
- JumpStart MicroBlogger (via TOP's Ruby on the Web) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-on-the-web)
- Recursive Fibonacci (via TOP's Recursion project) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/recursion)
- Merge Sort (as above)
- Searching Binary Trees (via TOP's Data Structures project) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/data-structures-and-algorithms)
- Knight's Traversal (as above)
- Connect Four (via TOP's Testing project) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/testing-ruby)
