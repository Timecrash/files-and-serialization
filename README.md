# ruby-projects
Considering all the projects I've been doing for The Odin Project lately, I figured I'll just start making one master-repo for everything. This will be for Ruby and possibly Rails projects.

Projects include:

-Hangman (via TOP's Files and Serialization) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/file-i-o-and-serialization)
